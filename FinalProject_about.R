           '<p style="text-align:justify">This course gave me the chance to learn new programming language for better data analysis. I sincerely appreciate Dr. Haviland Wright for sharing his knowledge and programming experience with us.
           It is too bad that I could not do my best for this course due to my heavy schedule for writing manuscript and visiting conference. However, I strongly believe that I did my best for the final project, even if it may look nothing. 
           For final project, I have read the class materials from cover to cover, but it does not seem to be enough to recover from a losing points. I will sincerely and seriously appreciate his helps, supports, and generosity for his grading policies. 
           At the begining of the last semester, I became a father (the name of my princess is Grace, now 8 month infant). Since no one helped my wife, I had to help her during semester. Also, I have submitted the first author research paper at the end of April while I have been taking 15 credits in this semester.
          I know how I am not good sutdent for this course and for you. I apologize you for those again. However, I am sure that I have learned a lot of new programming skills froma this course, which should be helpful for my future career. It is my last semester for my PhD coursework and I will take PhD comprehensive exam from June 1st. If I get under B, 
          I will lose my fellopship. If so, I will not be able to support my family.
            For these reasons (excuses), I need at least B. I will do more for the final project, if you think my current deliverables are not enough. Please let me know I need more than current one. Thanks for your time and considerations.'),
